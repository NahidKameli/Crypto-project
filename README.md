- Open-source and open for contributions to enhance features and functionality.

## Features
- üìä Real-time cryptocurrency price tracking using external APIs.
- üíª Responsive and modern UI built with React.
- ‚ö° Fast development and build process with Vite.
- üîç Search and filter cryptocurrencies (if implemented).
- ‚≠ê User-friendly interface for crypto enthusiasts and developers.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: ^18.x.x for building the user interface.
- **Vite**: ^5.x.x for fast development and bundling.
- **JavaScript**: Primary language for logic and API integration.
- **CSS**: Styling the application (25.2% of the codebase).
- **ESLint**: For maintaining code quality.
- **External APIs**: For fetching real-time cryptocurrency data (e.g., CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, or similar).
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and repository hosting.

## API Integration
This project integrates with a cryptocurrency API (e.g., [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) or [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)) to fetch real-time data such as:
- Current prices of cryptocurrencies.
- Market capitalization and trading volume.
- Historical price trends (if implemented).

To use the API:
1. Sign up for an API key from the provider (if required).
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
   ```env
   VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
